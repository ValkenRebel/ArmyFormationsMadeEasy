:: RECOMMENDED MODS ::
- Modified Troop Defaults - *** TO DO: Add Nexus link here ***
These are not necessary, but they will add quality of life enhancements to this mod

:: KNOWN ISSUES ::
• The 'F9' key is used by the game to 'Go Back', when the Orders menu is displayed. I've never found it to be an issue (as I don't use it), but it's something to be aware of.
• With quick update cycles being delivered by TaleWorlds - the base game's commands may be extended in the future, which may inhibit the Mod's use of F9, F10, F11, F12 keys.
